# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Place.create(name: "Mary", address: "321 4th st Brooklyn, NY")
# Place.create(name: "Jim", address: "444 44th st Brooklyn, NY")
# Place.create(name: "Sarah", address: "335 25th st Brooklyn, NY")
# Place.create(name: "Michael", address: "3 112th st Brooklyn, NY")
